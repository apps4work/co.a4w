            + "We discovered this was not because the tools weren't suitable for their customers' business but that we are in a different business.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "We are in the On-Demand Business - high-volume unique products, and not the long run business of high volumes of identical products - and the On-Demand Business demands a degree of automation that isn't necessary or affordable in the long run business. But not only does the on-demand business demand the automation, the automation of manufacturing requires the value that On-Demand Business brings to justify economically the cost the automation.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "Our problem is how to get the existing industry to grasp the On-Demand Business opportunity and to retool to be able to take advantage of it\n"

            + "\n"
            + "The solution we choose is an open competitive Marketplace for tools in contrast to the current closed limited marketplace for tools, which cannot keep up with the technology advancement, cannot embrace and exploit the power of algorithm writers nor support the needs of the  with the algorithm writers, or for them to prosper.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "This creates a dilemma for the incumbent tool providers. They can ignore the On-Demand Business, they do economically unjustifiable automation for the long run business, they can hope to stem the wave of algorithms or they can lead the way into it, or just come along for the ride. Our solution gives them the best chance to not being left behind.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "We show how existing software technology can be used to the benefit of both the existing tool providers and new algorithm providers, to the benefits of product developers and manufacturers and retailers, and ultimately to the benefit of the consumer.\n"

            + "\n"
            + "The Project is the means by which we can bring this to fruition. At its core it depends on the network effect, and in particular the benefits that algorithm providers can bring to the product Brands who are the data providers and data consumers. Making data available for algorithm writers to experiment with to develop successful algorithms and to prove them, is the best way for data providers and consumers to have better products. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "### Technical Details\n"
            + "\n"
            + "The technical details involve a relatively simple programming interface in a singular programming environment (JVM/WAS) that abstracts away the problem of where the data is coming from and the formatting of that data at the primitive level. it is a programming interface that speaks the same data structures as are in a JSON string.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "It is a programming interface, and not a file format, because the problem is programs talking to programs, and the solution to problems, including those inherent in Data File formats, is programs talking programs.\n"
            + "But the program can be manifested as file which makes did easy for people and systems to evolve from current practice to the future systems. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "Our system is essentially the wrapping of data sources in an abstraction analogous to JSON, which is a sufficiently comprehensive data structure to handle any current or future data format. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "Our solution is not Magic. It does not instantly make any program be able to speak to any other program.  \n"
            + "In particular programs can only work on data for which they understand  the semantics. Not just the values of primitives but the schema in which primitives are compounded into higher sematic objects.\n"
            + "This schema problem is potentially an infinite problem, since there is always more semantics that could be understood. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "Our solution breaks down the infinite schema problem into a series of finite schema problems starting at the most primitive JSON data types, through to any level of high semantics in the form of what we call typed JSON, which means schema names at any level of the hierarchy within the JSON.  It breaks down the infinite problem into a series of finite problems that we can be solved independently by interested participants, and where conflicts exist it can be solved in the only way that computers can solve complex which is with a program to translate one to the other.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "We chose infrastructure so that putting together these various programs that achieve schema transforms and algorithmic results can be made as simple as I've got an app for it.\n"
            + "The same core technology that runs apps on Android is used to run Apps for Work. The difference is that Apps For Work primarily run on a work computers/servers with an interface to a human, when necessary, using is a browser. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "In the same way that having Apps work on the phone was not an accident but requires the design of some rules to make it work, we propose rules to make Apps for Work work. There is no huge invention: little more than drawing the lines on a existing road to establish Lanes so that they can be used efficiently and effectively and avoid head-on collisions.  The technology demands that the Apps for Work makes would be very challenging but it's all been done, and is supported by major software organizations; it is battle-tested over the last 20 years, and, if it matters, it is available in versions that are free and open source.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "We have a new way for software, specifically for algorithms that add value to physical products specifications, to appropriate value  for their software, and for that software and other products in the supply-chain traditionally hidden from the consumer, to enter a vigorous, value-based, consumer-centric marketplace.\n"
