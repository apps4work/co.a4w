## Start Here; Read This First: How do you take your book?[^audiences]
[^audiences]:comment The point of this section is to address Kirby's issue that there are many different audiences interest in different aspects of what we are doing and don't care about other aspects. So this section is to steer them as fast as possible to the right part of the book, rather than have them read it as a novel, and get disinterested. The web page version uses links; the physical needs some other clear mechanism. (page references, and other ways of making it easy to find. Big Pictures, Big Titles, page colors, Tabs ...), and the links we have should be automatically translated into the content (each page numbers) for the physical book. It is really important that once we have triggered someone into opening the book, that they find what triggered them easily, and find that it is consistent with what triggered them.

This is an On Demand Business book so we intend to deliver _What you want, How you want it, When you want it_.

You can read the book from beginning to end following the prev/next links at the bottom of the page in the online version, swipe the page on your e-book, or use a manual page turner for the dead tree edition.

Or you can follow the links [page references] so that you can quickly get to the bits that interest you. If you are a link follower, you might find the online version easier. 
It is at [http://apps4work.info/book](http://apps4work.info/book). 

If you get the wikipedia-problem, come back and read it in the sequence we hope makes most sense. You can see that [here](Contents). 

Or you can take it [a la carte](index).

Or just [read on](Chapter-x-The-Story-in-One-Page) ...
